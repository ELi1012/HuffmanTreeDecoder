Assessment: Students were tasked with writing functions in util.py that would allow compress.py and
decompress.py to compress and decompress input files using a Huffman Tree decoder.

Running instructions: Using the command terminal, type 'python3 compress.py <file1> <file2> ...' to compress a file. To decompress a file, 
use the same procedure, replacing 'compress.py' with 'decompress.py'. Needs at least 1 file to run.

Notes and Assumptions:
    Acknowledgements: Thank you to Jordan Van Den Bruel for helping with the compress function.
